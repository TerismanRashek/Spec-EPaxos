# Spec-EPaxos

There are three existing modules for the execution, the commit, and the recovery protocols of EPaxos. As well as a SMRspec model.

To run the model, use the following command as a template :
java -cp $PATH_TO_tla2tools.jar$/tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC $SPEC_FILE_NAME$.tla
the .cfg file can be modified to change the parameters with which the model is ran.
